# Kaori Programming Language

**Kaori** is a statically typed programming language designed to be **simple**, **expressive**, and **readable**.  
It draws inspiration from modern languages like **Python** and **Rust**, combining their clarity and robustness in a minimal design.

Hereâ€™s a quick look at some syntax:

```kaori
def main() {
    $n = 5;
    print(fib(n));
}

def fib(n: number) -> number {
    if n < 2 {
        return n;
    }

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```
