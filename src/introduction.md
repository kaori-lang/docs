# Introduction

Welcome to **Kaori**, a programming language created as a personal learning journey into the world of compilers and language design.

## Purpose

Kaori is an **educational project** built to explore and understand how programming languages work from the ground up. This is a learning-focused endeavor aimed at demystifying the concepts behind:

-   Lexical analysis and parsing
-   Semantic analysis
-   Type systems and type inference
-   Compiler optimization techniques
-   Optimal bytecode generation and virtual machines

The primary goal is **education**â€”both for myself as the creator and for anyone interested in learning about compiler construction and language implementation.

## Who is This For?

This project and documentation are intended for:

-   Students interested in compiler design
-   Developers curious about how languages are built
-   Anyone who wants to peek under the hood of a programming language

The documentation aims to be as **informative as possible**, explaining not just how to use the language, but also the reasoning behind design decisions and implementation details.
