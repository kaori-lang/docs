# The First Hello World

Writing your first program in Kaori is quite simple and the main function does not need a return type annotation, because the entry point of the program does not need to return values.

```kaori
def main() {
    print("hello world");
}
```

That's it! Just define a `main` function and use the `print` statement to output text to the console.
